LociSelect
============

LociSelect is a simulated annealing algorithm for selecting loci (locations in DNA) from the output of a high-throughput DNA sequencer for use in genetic analyses.

This was my final project for CS 6364: Artificial Intelligence (taught by [Dan Moldovan](http://www.hlt.utdallas.edu/~moldovan/)). I took this course in the spring semester of 2015 while I was a master's student at The University of Texas at Dallas.

All of the parameters should be tuned in the source code. Don't be afraid... you can do it.

To run:

<code>python loci_select.py</code>
